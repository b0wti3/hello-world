# hell-world
My first foray into github!
I am a script kiddie and I know it! 
Time passes on and growth is made. 
Eventually the young grasshopper becomes an empty husk, and out of it a water skidder flies across the great expanse.

Plants grow and fires die. And here I am, squishing flies and pies. Want some fries?
